## Project: Futbol

### Group Member Names: Brian Greeson, David Tran, Tony Gomes, Krista Stadler

### Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):

Our goals are to learn how to build something in a team while properly using version control.
We want to focus on collaboration and working with others -- we will know we are successful when we have working program that was written collaboratively.

### Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):

Brian is technically proficient and happy answers questions over slack and in person.
Tony wants to focus on being a good follower during this project and wants to champion the data piece of the project.
Krista is well organized and will take the lead on project management.

### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):
Krista's availability is M-F 8:45am - 5pm and 8pm - 10pm
Saturday 12pm-5pm and 8pm-10pm
Sunday 9am-5pm and 8pm-10pm

David's schedule is flexible and he can meet any time.

Tony's availability is M-F 8-12 & 1-5 & 7-9
Sat-Sun 9-12 or 1-5

Brian's availability is M-F 8-12 & 1-5 & 6:30-10
Sat-Sun 12- 11


We'll have a daily standup at 8:45am.
We'll have group check in and work time from 8pm - 9pm.


### Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):

Our group expectation is that during times you're committed to working on the project, slack response is expected within 5 minutes -- at the very least, you should send a quick message to let the sender know when you will respond.

Tony prefers text messaging. We will all share our phone numbers but we do all expect good phone etiquette -- no calling or texting after 9pm.


### Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
All team members are flexible and willing to take on tasks and responsibilities as they arise.

### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):

No one should merge their own commits. We are planning to use GitHub Projects for project management.

### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

We all appreciate direct, actionable, and kind feedback.
Tony wanted everyone to know that he gets a little quiet and reserved and not to take it personally.
David emphasized that our feedback to each other shouldn't always be an agreement -- we should be willing to disagree and work through problems.
Krista is working on speaking up more in group settings and trying to be more confident in her opinions.

### Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):

Github Projects, TeleType

### Day 1 Agenda:
Look over project together -- read instructions and make project requirements are clear.
We have also planned our first group meeting for 9am on Monday, February 17th at Turing.
